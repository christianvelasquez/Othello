The files attached allow you to play the strategy board game Othello (Reversi) on a 16-square board using Java. 

The game features a player-vs.-computer mode in which players take turns placing their pieces (disks), which are either black or white, on the board. If your opponent's disk is flanked between your disk, then the opponent's disk is flipped to become one of your disks. The object of the game is to have the majority of your disks on the board by the end of the game. 

Each time a move is made, the game displays the current score and the legal moves for the next player's turn.
